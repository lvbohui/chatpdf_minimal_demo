Experimental Settings
All results in this paper is achieved with CFG-scale at 9.0. The sampler is DDIM. We use 20 steps by
default. We use three types of prompts to test the models:
(1) No prompt: We use empty string “” as prompt.
(2) Default prompt: Since Stable diffusion is essentially trained with prompts, the empty string might
be an unexpected input for the model, and SD tends to generate random texture maps if no prompt
is provided. A better setting is to use meaningless prompts like “an image”, “a nice image”, “a
professional image”, etc. In our setting, we use “a professional, detailed, high-quality image” as
default prompt.
(3) Automatic prompt: In order to test the state-of-the-art maximized quality of a fully automatic
pipeline, we also try to use automatic image captioning methods (e.g., BLIP [34]) to generate prompts
using the results obtained by “default prompt” mode. We use the generated prompt to diffusion again.
(4) User prompt: Users give the prompts.
