3 Method
ControlNet is a neural network architecture that can enhance pretrained image diffusion models
with task-specific conditions. We introduce ControlNetâ€™s essential structure and motivate of each
part in Section 3.1. We detail the method to apply ControlNets to image diffusion models using the
example of Stable Diffusion in Section 3.2. We elaborate the learning objective and general training
method in Section 3.3, and then describe several approaches to improve the training in extreme
cases such as training with one single laptop or using large-scale computing clusters in Section 3.4.
Finally, we include the details of several ControlNet implementations with different input conditions
in Section 3.5.
