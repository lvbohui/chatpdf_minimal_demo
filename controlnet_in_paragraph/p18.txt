Fig. 16 show that if the diffusion process is masked, the models can be used in pen-based image
editing.
Fig. 26 show that when object is relatively simple, the model can achieve relatively accurate control
of the details.
Fig. 27 shows that when ControlNet is only applied to 50% diffusion iterations, users can get results
that do not follow the input shapes.
